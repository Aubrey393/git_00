## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves


 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
 
 
All mimsy were the borogoves,


 And the mome raths outgrabe.
 
 
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!


 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
 
 


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

If I should die,


And you should live,


And time should gurgle on,


And morn should beam,


And noon should burn,


As it has usual done;


If birds should build as early,


And bees as bustling go,–


One might depart at option


From enterprise below!


‘Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand


When we with daisies lie,


That commerce will continue,


And trades as briskly fly.


It make the parting tranquil


And keeps the soul serene,


That gentlemen so sprightly


Conduct the pleasing scene!


– Emily Dickinson
